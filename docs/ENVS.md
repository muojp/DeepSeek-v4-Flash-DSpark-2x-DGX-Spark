# Environment variable matrix (Anemll 0.1.1 vs Stage-C overlay)

This recipe defaults to the prebuilt image:

```text
ghcr.io/anemll/dspark-vllm-gx10:0.1.1
```

A large set of `VLLM_DSPARK_*` / extra B12X knobs still appear in historical
Stage-C docs and in `recipe/overlay/vllm/envs.py`. **Those symbols are
registered in the Stage-C overlay build**, not necessarily in the Anemll
prebuilt image.

vLLM validates process environment keys that start with `VLLM_`. Unknown keys
log:

```text
Unknown vLLM environment variable detected: VLLM_…
```

and are **ignored** (warning only; serve still starts).

> **Important:** missing env registration does **not** mean DSpark or the Keys
> concurrency patches are absent from Anemll. Logic may be baked into the image
> without exposing every Stage-C kill-switch. Conversely, setting a Stage-C-only
> env on Anemll does **not** enable that kill-switch.

Audit date: **2026-07-29**, image tag **`ghcr.io/anemll/dspark-vllm-gx10:0.1.1`**,
by inspecting `vllm.envs.environment_variables` inside the container and
comparing to `recipe/overlay/vllm/envs.py` in this repo.

Re-check after image bumps:

```bash
docker run --rm --entrypoint python3 ghcr.io/anemll/dspark-vllm-gx10:0.1.1 - <<'PY'
import pathlib, vllm
ns = {}
exec(compile((pathlib.Path(vllm.__file__).parent / "envs.py").read_text(), "envs.py", "exec"), ns)
keys = ns["environment_variables"]
for k in sorted(keys):
    if any(s in k for s in ("B12", "DSPARK", "DSV4", "SPARSE_INDEXER", "FLASHINFER_SAMPLER")):
        print(k)

## Compose / `.env` knobs by lane

### A. Safe on Anemll 0.1.1 (registered `VLLM_*` or non-`VLLM_` runtime)

| Variable | Role |
|----------|------|
| `VLLM_ALLOW_LONG_MAX_MODEL_LEN` | Allow long context configs |
| `VLLM_SPARSE_INDEXER_MAX_LOGITS_MB` | Sparse indexer workspace cap |
| `VLLM_MEMORY_PROFILER_ESTIMATE_CUDAGRAPHS` | Profiler / capture estimate |
| `VLLM_USE_FLASHINFER_SAMPLER` | FlashInfer sampler |
| `VLLM_EXECUTE_MODEL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `sample_tokens` RPC deadline (compose default **1800**; stock vLLM is 300). Issue #65/#87: mid-serve CuTeDSL/TileLang JIT can exceed 300s and kill EngineCore on TP=2. |
| `VLLM_USE_BREAKABLE_CUDAGRAPH` | Set `0` to opt out of DS4's automatic breakable-graph mode and retain regular CUDA graphs |
| `VLLM_USE_B12X_MOE` | Enable B12X MoE path |
| `VLLM_B12X_W4A16_FORCE_BLOCKS_PER_SM` | Experimental W4A16 selector |
| `VLLM_B12X_W4A16_FORCE_BLOCKS_MAX_M` | Experimental W4A16 selector |
| `VLLM_B12X_W4A16_FORCE_TILE_CONFIG` | Experimental W4A16 selector |
| `VLLM_HOST_IP` | Distributed bind address |
| `VLLM_PREFIX_CACHE_RETENTION_INTERVAL` | Issue #26: sparsify SWA prefix-cache checkpoints (default 4096). This is the warm-hit fix; the coordinator must still let SWA shrink the common hit (hotfix v2, issue #36). |
| `VLLM_ENABLE_RESPONSES_API_STORE` | Native vLLM Responses state switch, normalized to exact `1`; default `0` keeps stock `serving.py` bytes. Enabled starts source-check and apply the bounded-store backport fail-closed on every rank. Stored state is lost on any process restart. Recreate every rank when changing it; a Docker restart preserves patched writable-layer bytes, not state. |
| `DSPARK_RESPONSES_STORE_MAX_ENTRIES` | Terminal Responses bundle cap, default **256**. Positive decimal when the store is enabled; invalid values fail before remote side effects. Eviction removes response/message/background-event state together and LRU-touches retrieval/continuation. Queued, in-progress, pinned continuation, and tracked producer state may temporarily exceed the entry cap; this is not a retained-byte limit. |
| `VLLM_CACHE_ROOT` | vLLM cache root (compose sets path) |
| `CUTE_DSL_ARCH` | **Not** `VLLM_*` — CuTeDSL/b12x compile target (`sm_121a` on GB10) |
| `TILELANG_CACHE_DIR` | **Not** `VLLM_*`. Compose default `/cache/huggingface/tilelang-cache` (HF volume). Issue #65: in-image `~/.tilelang/cache` dies on container recreate. |
| `TRITON_CACHE_DIR` | **Not** `VLLM_*`. Compose default `/cache/huggingface/triton-cache` (HF volume). Issue #117: in-image `~/.triton/cache` dies on container recreate, so known shapes re-JIT mid-serve after every restart — and a compiling rank can stall its TP peer past torch's 600s NCCL watchdog. |
| `TORCH_FR_BUFFER_SIZE` | **Not** `VLLM_*`. Compose default `2000` (torch 2.11 default, pinned). Canonical ring-buffer-size control for PyTorch's ProcessGroupNCCL flight recorder; `>0` is required for dump-on-timeout and the pipe trigger below. The older `TORCH_NCCL_TRACE_BUFFER_SIZE` spelling is deprecated by the pinned runtime and is not forwarded. |
| `TORCH_NCCL_DUMP_ON_TIMEOUT` | **Not** `VLLM_*`. Compose default `1`. Dump the flight-recorder ring buffer when torch's NCCL watchdog hits its timeout; per the torch header it must be paired with `TORCH_NCCL_ENABLE_MONITORING=1` (also pinned to `1` in compose) and a nonzero buffer size. |
| `TORCH_FR_DUMP_TEMP_FILE` | **Not** `VLLM_*`. Compose default `/cache/huggingface/nccl-fr/comm_lib_trace_rank_` (HF volume; rank id appended). Where flight-recorder dumps land — persisted so a killed pair still leaves per-rank evidence for `torchfrtrace`. The entrypoint creates the directory non-fatally; older torch reads `TORCH_NCCL_DEBUG_INFO_TEMP_FILE` instead. **Filenames are static per rank and torch truncates on every dump** — preservation is the operator's job: archive `comm_lib_trace_rank_*` from **both** nodes together after every dump, before the next poke or timeout overwrites them (`torchfrtrace` needs the complete rank set in one directory; each node's volume only holds its own rank's file). |
| `TORCH_NCCL_DEBUG_INFO_PIPE_FILE` | **Not** `VLLM_*`. Compose default `/tmp/fr_dump_pipe_`. The stem lives on `/tmp` because torch `TORCH_CHECK`s the mkfifo at process-group init — it must never point at a directory that might not exist (an unmounted volume dir would fail the boot). In this compose stack `/tmp` is **not** container-local: it is the `DSPARK_TMP_HOST` bind mount (host default `~/.cache/dspark-tmp`), so the FIFO is also host-visible there — root-owned, so host-side pokes need root, or use `docker exec`; torch unlinks and recreates a stale FIFO left by a previous container. Torch creates `<stem><rank>.pipe`; writing anything to it triggers an on-demand flight-recorder dump — the hook an external watchdog uses to capture evidence from a frozen-but-not-timed-out rank before restarting the pair. **A poke is asynchronous and best-effort** (torch launches the dump via `std::async` and never waits): after poking, wait for torch's `Finished writing Flight Recorder debug info` log line, or for the dump file to appear and its size to settle (bounded wait), before killing or restarting the pair — an immediate restart can kill the writer mid-dump and leave a truncated or missing file. |
| `B12X_CUTE_COMPILE_CACHE_DIR` | **Not** `VLLM_*`. Compose default `/cache/huggingface/b12x-cute-cache` (HF volume). Issue #117 family, third JIT cache: the B12X MoE backend's CuTeDSL compile cache defaults to in-image `~/.cache/b12x/cute_compile` and dies on container recreate, so `W4A16FusedMoeKernel` re-JITs after every restart (`jit_monitor` flags it as "CuTeDSL JIT compilation during inference"). |
| `DSPARK_BOOT_SHAPE_WARMUP` | Launcher-side (not passed to the container). `1` (default) runs `scripts/boot-shape-warmup.sh` after the smoke request. `_prepare_dflash_inputs_kernel` keys on `next_pow2(scheduled_tokens + 6)` only — request concurrency does not enter the key — so coverage comes from a deterministic ladder of exact-token plain completions (s = 1/6/20/45/100/200, each verified via an authenticated `/tokenize` before firing) hitting every live BLOCK key {8,16,32,64,128,256}. Chat arms C=1/2/4/6 up to the launcher's resolved `MAX_NUM_SEQS` cover both bounded longer prompts and ordinary short requests with client-default generation settings; medium/long-prefill and thinking-off cover other batch-keyed variants. `0` skips. Warmup failure is a WARN, never a boot failure. |
| `DSPARK_WORKER_HF_NFS` | Launcher-side. `0` (default): bind a local worker checkpoint (`prepare` downloads on both nodes). `1`: worker mounts the head HuggingFace cache over NFSv4 on `NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME` (ConnectX). Hub weights are not copied to the worker. JIT dirs (`triton-cache`, `tilelang-cache`, `vllm-cache`, `flashinfer`, `b12x-cute-cache`, `nccl-fr`) are local overlays under `WORKER_HF_CACHE`. Reuses a live NFSv4 exporter on that address (e.g. Qwen `vllm-fn-nfs`). |
| `DSPARK_WARMUP_REQ_TIMEOUT` | Launcher-side (read by `scripts/boot-shape-warmup.sh`, not passed to the container). Per-request curl `--max-time`, seconds, default **240** — first-ever boots pay real Triton compiles per request. Sequential worst case is 35 × timeout at the shipped `MAX_NUM_SEQS=6` default (23 × at `MAX_NUM_SEQS=4`) before the sweep exits nonzero and the launcher WARNs (non-fatal); raise it rather than skipping the sweep if first-boot compiles exceed the default. |
| `TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST` / `FLASHINFER_CUDA_ARCH_LIST` | Build/JIT arch lists |
| `NCCL_*` / `TP_SOCKET_IFNAME` / `GLOO_SOCKET_IFNAME` | Fabric |
| `NCCL_IB_MERGE_NICS` | Passthrough, default **unset**. Contract for all four passthrough knobs below: a configured non-empty value passes through unchanged; an empty value is normalized to absent (the entrypoint unsets empty definitions before exec, so NCCL's built-in default and config-file values still apply and cannot be masked). NCCL's own default is `1`: it *permits* merging compatible dual-port NICs; it does not select HCAs or force arbitrary links (`NCCL_NET_MERGE_LEVEL`/`NCCL_NET_FORCE_MERGE` participate in that topology decision). `0` disables merging. |
| `NCCL_NET_GDR_LEVEL` | Passthrough, default **unset**. Upstream GPUDirect RDMA override; no effect demonstrated on the submitted GB10 stack (see `NCCL_DMABUF_ENABLE`). |
| `NCCL_NET_GDR_READ` | Passthrough, default **unset**. Upstream GPUDirect RDMA override; no effect demonstrated on the submitted GB10 stack. |
| `NCCL_DMABUF_ENABLE` | Passthrough, default **unset**. `0` disables DMA-BUF probing (workaround control). Contributor-reported observation on GB10 driver `580.173.02`, that stack only: the container reported `CU_DEVICE_ATTRIBUTE_DMA_BUF_SUPPORTED=0` and boot logs showed `via NET/IB/x` with no `/GDRDMA`; no GDR effect was demonstrated there, which is not a claim about GDR availability in general. |
| `NCCL_GIN_ENABLE` | Passthrough, default **unset** (= NCCL's enabled default, GPU-initiated networking). Exact `0` selects the CPU-driven comm-init path: measured 2026-09-05 on the 2-node lane at ~97% GPU memory pressure, comm-init drops from ~2 min to ~13 s with no bandwidth change at serving message sizes. Bootstrap-speed knob only. |
| `HF_*` / `TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE` | Hub cache behavior |
| `MTP_NUM_TOKENS` | Consumed by compose command line (not a vLLM env registry key) |
| `WORKER2_HOST` / `WORKER2_VLLM_HOST_IP` / `WORKER2_DIR` / `WORKER2_HF_CACHE` | Launcher-side, `./start-tp3.sh` only (`docs/TP3.md`). Third rank: SSH target, its RoCE IP, repo dir and JIT-cache dir (default to the `WORKER_*` values). Stop/status/logs/prepare also address it whenever `WORKER2_HOST` is set. Prerequisites: passwordless SSH and the pinned image already pulled there. |
| `WORKER2_NCCL_IB_HCA` / `WORKER2_NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME` / `WORKER2_TP_SOCKET_IFNAME` / `WORKER2_GLOO_SOCKET_IFNAME` | Launcher-side, TP=3 only. spark3's ConnectX port facing the head (not a copy of `WORKER_NCCL_*`). The launcher then moves Gloo/NCCL-socket/TP bootstrap onto `TP3_BOOTSTRAP_IFNAME` (default `enP7s7`) and sets `NCCL_IB_HCA` to both CX ports with `NCCL_IB_MERGE_NICS=0`, `NCCL_IB_SUBNET_AWARE_ROUTING=1`, `NCCL_IB_SUBNET_PREFIX_LEN=24`. |
| `WORKER2_NFS_SERVER_IP` | Launcher-side, TP=3 only. Head IP on the spark1↔spark3 link (e.g. `10.0.23.1`, not the spark1↔spark2 `10.0.22.1`); its `/24` is added to the NFS export when possible. |
| `TP3_MAX_NUM_SEQS` / `TP3_BOOTSTRAP_IFNAME` / `TP3_NCCL_IB_HCA` | Launcher-side, TP=3 only. Slots for the 3-node lane (CLI `--max-num-seqs` wins; the 2-node start ignores it), bootstrap LAN interface (never `lo`), and an override for the two-port `NCCL_IB_HCA` list if the roce names differ. Capture size follows `MAX_NUM_SEQS * (MTP_NUM_TOKENS + 1)` rounded up to a multiple of 8 (112 at 16 slots). |
| `DSPARK_MAX_INFLIGHT_PREFILLS` | **Not** `VLLM_*`. Read once by the issue #27 hotfix at Scheduler construction (Anemll 0.1.1 rejects `--max-num-partial-prefills`). Compose default **`1`** (strictly serialized): the post-#211 exact admission gate is live-qualified at 1 (repeated fresh-boot gate26 spreads 1.60–1.76×, zero preemptions). `2` is an evidence-backed opt-in, operator-qualified post-r3 on TP=2 with `LONG_PREFILL_TOKEN_THRESHOLD=1024` ([#217](https://github.com/MiaAI-Lab/DeepSeek-v4-Flash-DSpark-2x-DGX-Spark/issues/217): ABA over three fresh boots, 4 × 8K gate26 spread 1.50–1.57× at `2` vs 1.53× at `1`, zero preemptions at both, TTFT spread 2.1–2.4× vs 4.1× at `1`), trading admission serialization for TTFT/equity on admission-limited shapes; on 4 × 32K bursts `2` widens the gate26 spread (3.0–3.3× vs 2.1×) with no lane starved (end-to-end spread ≤ 1.14× at both caps). `3` remains an explicit opt-in: a separate, limited [cap-3 sample](https://github.com/MiaAI-Lab/DeepSeek-v4-Flash-DSpark-2x-DGX-Spark/issues/217#issuecomment-5554973680) improved 4 × 8K spread but worsened median TTFT on 8-wide bursts; it is not the same qualification as `2`. The 2026-09-02 A/B that first favored `2` (`docs/CLAUDE/ab-results-2026-09-03.md`) predates the r3 counting fix. Values above 3 clamp to 3; malformed values fall back to stock with one warning. |
| `DRAFT_SAMPLE_METHOD` | DSpark `draft_sample_method` in `--speculative-config`. Compose default **`probabilistic`** (the previously hardcoded value). `greedy` is what the official model cards pair with `num_speculative_tokens=7` (issue #84). Consumed by the compose command line, not a vLLM env registry key. The entrypoint (and `validate-dspark-config.sh`) accept exactly `probabilistic`/`greedy` and exit nonzero on anything else, so the raw value never reaches the `--speculative-config` JSON. |
| `DSPARK_SUPPRESS_STOPS_IN_REASONING` | `1` (default): after the detokenizer hotfix, client `stop` stays dormant until `</think>`. `0` restores stock matching. Also accepts Tony's `VLLM_SUPPRESS_STOPS_IN_REASONING` via compose interpolation (not added as a compose `VLLM_*` key, so Anemll does not warn). |
| `DSPARK_SKIP_SUPPRESS_STOPS_HOTFIX` | `1` skips applying `patches/hotfix-dsv4-suppress-stops-in-reasoning.py` |
| `LIMIT_MM_PER_PROMPT` | Compose CLI `--limit-mm-per-prompt`. Default JSON `{"image":8}`. `image=N` is converted (Anemll argparse is `json.loads` only). Vision-Exp images only, and only in `user` messages (`system`/`assistant` → HTTP 400). No video. |
| `DSPARK_SKIP_SPIN_WAIT_HOTFIX` | `1` skips `patches/hotfix-gb10-spin-wait.sh` (issue #79: `busy_loop_s` 1s→2ms) |
| `DSPARK_SKIP_ISSUE117_RECHECK_HOTFIX` | Default `0`: source-exact upstream vLLM #45224 backport bounds mid-serve missed-notify recovery at 5,000 ms and releases read slots on consumer exceptions. `1` skips only issue #117; issue #79 remains independent. Changing it requires paired stop/removal/recreate. It does not clean orphaned SHM objects. |
| `DSPARK_ENABLE_ISSUE31_GPU_HOTFIX` | **Not** `VLLM_*`. Default `0` = stock V2 (no thinking_token_budget). `1` applies the GPU budget hotfix at boot (fail-closed). Issue #66: default-on omit-field traffic can hit a decode cliff. |
| `DSPARK_ENABLE_ISSUE138_RESPONSES_HISTORY_COMPAT` | **Not** `VLLM_*`. Default `0` (and every non-`1` value) keeps stock `/v1/responses` request validation. Exact `1` fail-closed patches the pinned request model to accept only a type-less assistant replay with one string `output_text` part, preserving supplied `id`, `status`, `phase`, annotations, logprobs, and all typed item behavior. This does **not** enable the Responses store or change `previous_response_id`. |
| `DSPARK_ENABLE_CODEX_AGENT_MESSAGE_COMPAT` | **Not** `VLLM_*`. Default `0` (and every non-`1` value) preserves stock rejection of Codex's private `agent_message` item. Exact `1` fail-closed converts only the evidenced exact-key shape with one string `input_text` part to `message(role=assistant)`. It irreversibly drops `id`, `author`, `recipient`, and internal chat metadata; malformed, extended, multipart, and unknown items retain stock rejection. When issue #138 is also enabled, issue138 applies first; both patchers recognize the exact combined postimage so same-container restarts remain idempotent. |
| `DSPARK_ENABLE_ISSUE141_SPARSE_MLA_CHUNK` | **Not** `VLLM_*`. Default `0` leaves the pinned Anemll 0.1.1 SM120 adapter bytes and behavior stock. Only exact `1` runs the issue #141 workaround before vLLM import: source-lock the complete adapter method plus relevant pinned FlashInfer contracts, then keep oversized sparse-MLA decode calls on ordered views of at most the fixed 64-row kernel boundary. Drift or publication failure aborts before `exec vllm`; there is no tunable chunk size. The failure and workaround evidence are stochastic and the 64/65 A/B exists on one pair only, so this avoids a path and is not a root-cause fix. Enable or roll back with the paired `./stop-deepseek-v4-flash-dspark.sh` then `./start-deepseek-v4-flash-dspark.sh` flow so both containers are recreated; a process or `docker compose restart` retains writable-layer patch bytes. |
| `DSPARK_ENABLE_ISSUE136_XGRAMMAR_HOTFIX` | **Not** `VLLM_*`. Default `0` = the chain patcher is never invoked (the default #44993 train may still alter `structured_output/__init__.py` independently). Exact `1` enables the source-exact XGrammar backport chain (vLLM #52805 termination + #53046 post-reasoning draft validation; issues #136/#210) only for image `0.1.1@sha256:a8394849…`, vLLM `0.25.2.dev0+g752a3a504.d20260714`, and xgrammar `0.2.3`; incompatibility/apply failure is fail-closed, and a two-file publish failure rolls the first file back exactly. The launcher checks worker then head before either service starts. |
| `DSPARK_ENABLE_ISSUE191_TOOLCALL_FAILCLOSED` | **Not** `VLLM_*`. Default `0` = stock serving bytes. Exact `1` applies the source-exact issue #191 contract check to the pinned post-issue55 `entrypoints/openai/chat_completion/serving.py` (vLLM `0.25.2.dev0+g752a3a504.d20260714`): non-streaming Chat requests with a named or `required` `tool_choice` must return exactly one call when `parallel_tool_calls=false`, the right tool name, JSON-object arguments, and (for `strict` tools) schema-valid arguments. Incompatible bytes fail closed at boot; the launcher checks worker then head before either rank starts. |
| `DSPARK_ISSUE191_TOOLCALL_RETRIES` | Bounded regeneration count (0–5, default `2`) used only with `DSPARK_ISSUE191_TOOLCALL_MODE=failclosed`. After the last failed attempt the request answers HTTP 500 with `[issue191-toolcall] … reason=` instead of a wrong 200. |
| `DSPARK_ISSUE191_TOOLCALL_MODE` | `failclosed` (default) or `log`. `log` only writes the WARNING line per violation (measurement mode for the 145-case gate); the response is returned unchanged. |
| `DSPARK_ISSUE191_TOOLCALL_THINKOFF_FALLBACK` | `1` (default) makes the **last** `failclosed` retry regenerate with thinking off: the prompt's trailing `<think>` marker becomes `</think>` (what `thinking=false` renders), the engine gets `reasoning_ended=True`, and the reply is parsed with a thinking-off parser. Fixes the measured residual failure (reasoning outran `max_tokens`, `finish_reason=length`) inside the client's budget; logged as `[issue191-toolcall] regenerating … fallback=thinkoff`. `0` keeps every retry identical. Needs `DSPARK_ISSUE191_TOOLCALL_RETRIES >= 1`. |
| `DSPARK_ASYNC_SCHEDULING` | `1` (default) keeps `--async-scheduling`; `0` removes it on both ranks for the issue #191 single-variable A/B (grammar bitmask rows are then built from real draft tokens instead of async placeholders). Any other value fails the launcher. |
| `DSPARK_ENABLE_DSPARK_BLOCK_K` | **Not** `VLLM_*`. Default `0` = stock `config/speculative.py`. Exact `1` applies `patches/hotfix-vllm-dspark-block-k.py` (source-exact, `--check` preflight worker then head): the `num_speculative_tokens % n_predict` "MTP module reuse" rule no longer applies to `method=dspark` (stacked stages, one parallel block pass), and the launcher only requires `MTP_NUM_TOKENS >= 1`. Use it to run Vision-Exp (`num_nextn_predict_layers=3`) at the trained `dspark_block_size=5` instead of the forced k=6. |
| `DSPARK_ENABLE_ROPE_SWA_FIX` | **Not** `VLLM_*`. Default `0` = stock rope builder (YaRN on every non-`default` layer, sparse-SWA included). Exact `1` applies `patches/hotfix-vllm-rope-swa-fix.py` at boot (source-exact port of upstream vllm#54815, fail-closed, `--check` preflight worker then head): sparse-SWA layers (`compress_ratio<=1` — layers 0–1 plus the 3 DSpark drafter layers) get plain RoPE (identity `factor=1.0` over `max_position_embeddings`, theta `10000`); compressor layers stay byte-identical to stock. Recreate both ranks when flipping. Gate a 128K+ long-context quality A/B before defaulting on. See `docs/PATCHES.md`. |
| `DSPARK_ENABLE_DSPARK_SWA_PREFIX` | **Not** `VLLM_*`. Default `0` = stock prefix-cache hits. Exact `1` applies `patches/hotfix-vllm-dspark-swa-prefix.py` at boot (source-exact, fail-closed, `--check` preflight worker then head): prefix-cache hits are capped so the target always recomputes the last `sliding_window` (128) draft tokens and the DSpark draft's SWA cache is never left unpopulated (upstream Anemll/dspark-vllm-gx10#2 — repeated identical prompts otherwise degenerate to a truncated response). No effect without DSpark. See `docs/PATCHES.md`. |
| `DSPARK_ENABLE_DSML_RECOVERY` | **Not** `VLLM_*`. Default `0` = stock parser (a DSML invoke with a missing or corrupted outer `tool_calls` wrapper leaks verbatim into content). Exact `1` applies `patches/hotfix-vllm-dsml-recovery.py` at boot (source-exact port of open upstream vllm#52645, fail-closed, `--check` preflight worker then head; 6 parser files pinned by whole-file identity): a bare `<invoke name="...">` seen from content or reasoning becomes a provisional tool call, is validated against the live request's declared tools, commits only on `</invoke>`, and rolls back verbatim otherwise (undeclared tool, no tools, `tool_choice="none"`, truncation); one trailing outer closer is absorbed and V3.2 `function_calls` wrappers stay verbatim. Correctly wrapped DSML is byte-identical to stock (`scripts/test-dsml-recovery.py` proves parity). Recreate both ranks when flipping. See `docs/PATCHES.md`. |
| `DSPARK_ENABLE_SP_INDEXER` | **Not** `VLLM_*`. Default `0` = stock. Exact `1` applies `patches/hotfix-dsv4-sp-indexer-prefill.py` at boot (fail-closed): prefill chunks with ≥ `DSPARK_SP_INDEXER_MIN_KEYS` compressed keys (default `8192`) are scored sequence-parallel across TP ranks and merged exactly with the DCP stable-topk selector; decode and shorter chunks keep the replicated path. Recreate both ranks when flipping. See `docs/PATCHES.md`. |
| `DSPARK_SP_INDEXER_MIN_KEYS` | **Not** `VLLM_*`. Runtime threshold (compressed keys per chunk) for the SP indexer path; `0` disables it even when the patch is applied. |
| `DSPARK_ENABLE_DEEPGEMM_SM121_ALIAS` | **Not** `VLLM_*`. Default `0`. Exact `1` writes `sm121_*` alias headers for DeepGEMM's indexer-logits kernels so a JIT-cache miss on GB10 can compile (the image ships `sm120_*` only). See `docs/CLAUDE/item8-fp4-kv-design.md` §5. |
| `DSPARK_ENABLE_MXFP4_INDEXER_CACHE` | **Not** `VLLM_*`. Default `0` = stock FP8 indexer K cache. Exact `1` applies `patches/hotfix-vllm-mxfp4-indexer-cache.py` at boot (source-exact, fail-closed, `--check` preflight worker then head) — the fp4 indexer gate in `v1/attention/backends/mla/indexer.py` also accepts consumer Blackwell (sm_12x, GB10) — and passes `--attention-config '{"use_fp4_indexer_cache":true}'` on both ranks: the Lightning indexer writes packed MXFP4 K and the DeepGEMM logits kernels read half the bytes per scored key (allocation stays 132 B/row in the pinned image). Launcher-enforced companion: `DSPARK_ENABLE_DEEPGEMM_SM121_ALIAS=1` (the fp4 kernels are not in the persisted JIT cache; first enabled boot JIT-compiles). Recreate both ranks when flipping. Gate ruler-lite 32K/131K + garble-to-900K + 128K TTFT A/B before defaulting on. See `docs/PATCHES.md`. |
| `DSPARK_ENABLE_C128A_PREFILL_CACHE` | Default `0`. Exact `1` applies `patches/hotfix-vllm-c128a-prefill-cache.py` on every rank after compatibility preflight. Pinned Anemll 0.1.1 only: the SM120 C128A prefill consumer reuses its unchanged index conversion across layers sharing one forward's metadata. C4A and decode are unchanged; no persistent buffers are added. Host override: `DSPARK_C128A_PREFILL_CACHE_HOTFIX`, synchronized to the canonical worker path. Recreate containers with the gate disabled to restore stock. See `docs/PATCHES.md`. |
| `ABLATE` | Internal. Set automatically when `ABLITERATED=1`. Do not set `ABLATE=1` alone; start fails closed until `prepare --abliterated` has stored the gated Keys `RESPONSIBLE_USE.md` plus the 18 KiB direction under `HF_CACHE/dspark-ablation/`. |
| `DSV4_ABLATE_LAMBDA` | Runtime projection strength, default `3.5`; parsed only for `ABLATE=1` and must be finite/non-negative. λ ≥ 4 risks long-CoT degeneration. It participates in the AOT-cache compatibility stamp. |
| `DSV4_ABLATE_LAYERS` | Inclusive target decoder range, default `10-42`; launcher restricts it to ordered layers within `0-42`, excluding the DSpark draft. It participates in the AOT-cache stamp. |
| `DSPARK_ABLATE_SOURCE_FILE` | Launcher-side direction source, default `$HF_CACHE/dspark-ablation/direction_r1.pt` after `prepare --abliterated`. Relative paths resolve from the repo. The launcher SHA-256-verifies it; the container sees `/cache/huggingface/dspark-ablation/direction_r1.pt`. |
| `VLLM_API_KEY` | **Optional single-key auth** for the OpenAI endpoint, consumed natively by vLLM (its `--api-key` env alias). Empty (default) = no auth. Exactly one key. Mutually exclusive with `DSPARK_API_KEYS`. |
| `DSPARK_API_KEYS` | **Optional multi-key auth**, enforced by vLLM itself. Single-line keys use literal space/tab separators and are flattened into **one** `--api-key` flag (nargs list; repeating the flag would overwrite). Empty or space/tab-only (default) adds no flag, preserving stock behavior. Parsing trims/collapses separators, preserves order, allows duplicates, rejects CR/LF/VT/FF before empty classification, rejects backslashes, and rejects tokens starting with `-` without echoing token bytes (exit 2); it must be set in `.env.dspark`, not the shell. **Mutually exclusive with `VLLM_API_KEY`**: if both are meaningful, the entrypoint and `start-`/`smoke-`/`status-*.sh` scripts exit 2 before patch/install work. Every route outside the guarded prefixes `/v1`, `/v2`, `/inference` is keyless. On the pinned runtime that includes `POST /invocations` and `POST /generative_scoring` (both run inference unauthenticated) and the `/tokenize` / `/detokenize` utility routes, besides `/health`, `/metrics`, `/version`, `/ping`; a keyed deployment still needs network-level access control on the server port. Keys remain container argv/env, so rotation needs a stop/start; vLLM provides revocation rather than per-key request attribution. |
| `patches/hotfix-vllm-redact-api-key-log.sh` | Key-log redaction hotfix, required whenever either key variable is configured; apply + `--status` must succeed or the entrypoint fails the container before exec vllm, and `--status` exits nonzero unless every check passes. Upstream `log_non_default_args()` prints every `--api-key` value verbatim; the patch redacts that logger for both entrypoints while preserving the count as `'api_key': ['<redacted:N value(s)>']`. This closes the log channel only; keys remain visible through `docker inspect` / host `ps`. |

#### Issue #136 operator sequence

Enable/`--check`/`--status` semantics and exit codes, the launcher's
worker/head preflight order, the required live closure gate, and the
two-node stop/removal rollback rule (a process or Docker restart is **not**
rollback) are documented in
[`PATCHES.md`](PATCHES.md#issue-136--xgrammar-accepts-speculative-tokens-after-termination).

### B. Stage-C / overlay-registered only (warn + no-op on Anemll 0.1.1)

These appear in `recipe/overlay/vllm/envs.py` and in older validated Stage-C
lanes. On Anemll **0.1.1** they are **not** in `environment_variables` and only
produce unknown-env warnings if injected.

| Variable | Stage-C intent (summary) |
|----------|---------------------------|
| `VLLM_USE_B12X_WO_PROJECTION` | B12X WO projection path |
| `VLLM_DSPARK_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD` | Draft confidence threshold |
| `VLLM_DSPARK_CONFIDENCE_SCHEDULER` | Confidence scheduler mode |
| `VLLM_DSPARK_LOCAL_ARGMAX` | Local argmax draft path |
| `VLLM_DSPARK_REPLICATE_MARKOV_W1` | Markov W1 replicate |
| `VLLM_DSPARK_FUSED_MARKOV_ARGMAX` | Fused Markov argmax |
| `VLLM_DSPARK_GPU_REJECTED_CONTEXT_MASK` | GPU rejected-context mask (Keys ragged path switch in overlay) |
| `VLLM_DSPARK_REFERENCE_KV_QUANT_DEQUANT` | Reference KV quant/dequant |
| `VLLM_DSPARK_HARDWARE_SCHEDULER_EARLY_STOP` | Hardware scheduler early stop |
| `VLLM_DSV4_B12X_COMPRESSED_MLA` | Compressed MLA experiment |
| `VLLM_DSV4_DSPARK_DEFER_TARGET_CAPTURE` | Defer target cudagraph capture |
| `VLLM_DSV4_DSPARK_DEFER_TARGET_CAPTURE_EXACT` | Exact defer variant |

Default Anemll compose **does not** inject these. For Stage-C images, merge:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.dspark \
  -f docker-compose.dspark.yml \
  -f docker-compose.stage-c.override.yml \
  up -d
```

(see `docker-compose.stage-c.override.yml`).

### C. Not registered as `VLLM_*` on either lane (or host-only)

| Variable | Notes |
|----------|--------|
| `VLLM_TRITON_MLA_SPARSE` | Not in Anemll 0.1.1 registry; not found as overlay registration in the same form — avoid on Anemll |
| `VLLM_SKIP_INIT_MEMORY_CHECK` | Not in Anemll 0.1.1 registry — avoid on Anemll |
| `DSPARK_SLOT_CLAMP` | Non-`VLLM_` prefix (no unknown-`VLLM_` warning). Only meaningful if the image reads it; treat as Stage-C/overlay unless confirmed |
| `B12X_W4A16_TC_DECODE` | Non-`VLLM_` package/debug knob |
| `VLLM_HOST` / `VLLM_PORT` | Used by **compose command substitution** / start scripts, not as in-process vLLM config envs in the same way as registry keys |
| `HF_TOKEN` / `HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN` | **Prepare only.** Forwarded into the download container (`-e`) on head and worker. Not passed to `vllm serve`. Prefer a shell export; a value in `.env.dspark` is scp'd to the worker. |
| `DSPARK_MODEL`, `DSPARK_REVISION`, `DSPARK_VLLM_IMAGE`, `ENABLE_VLLM_GB10_PATCH`, … | Launcher / compose only |
| `DSPARK_RESTART_POLICY` | Compose `restart:` (default `unless-stopped`, issue #38). After a reboot, dockerd restores the ranks, so `./start-…` exits **3** (already running) rather than 1. Supervising the launcher: set systemd `SuccessExitStatus=3` + `RemainAfterExit=yes`, or set `DSPARK_RESTART_POLICY=no` if the unit owns start/stop. Exit 3 does **not** prove the TP group is healthy (head-only reboot can leave a stale worker). |
| `DSPARK_STOP_GRACE` | Compose `stop_grace_period` (default `10s`; do not use 180s — hangs stop) |

## Recommended defaults by image

### Anemll `ghcr.io/anemll/dspark-vllm-gx10:0.1.1` (repo default)

Keep the slim set in `.env.dspark.example` + `docker-compose.dspark.yml`:

- Serve profile: `MTP_NUM_TOKENS=6` on Vision-Exp (`k % 3 == 0` and `k >= 5`), capture `max_num_seqs * (k+1)`, `GPU_MEMORY_UTILIZATION≈0.80`
- `VLLM_USE_BREAKABLE_CUDAGRAPH=0` (explicit opt-out; omission auto-enables the slower breakable path on DS4)
- `VLLM_USE_B12X_MOE=1`
- `CUTE_DSL_ARCH=sm_121a` (GB10 CuTeDSL target; prevents slower JIT fallbacks)
- Do **not** rely on Stage-C-only `VLLM_DSPARK_*` for behavior on this tag

### Stage-C `vllm-dspark-runtime:dspark-nvfp4-stage-c`

- Build via `./build-dspark-vllm-runtime.sh`
- Set `DSPARK_VLLM_IMAGE=vllm-dspark-runtime:dspark-nvfp4-stage-c`
- Enable the Stage-C override compose file and the Stage-C block in `.env.dspark.example`
- Then the Keys-oriented switches (e.g. `VLLM_DSPARK_GPU_REJECTED_CONTEXT_MASK=1`) are meaningful

## What this does *not* claim

- It does **not** invalidate published Anemll decode benches. Throughput can be
  real while unused envs only add log noise.
- It does **not** assert Anemll lacks concurrency fixes—only that several
  **env kill-switches** from the overlay are not exposed on 0.1.1.
- Image tags after 0.1.1 may register more keys; re-run the audit snippet above.
| `DSPARK_TOKENTRACE_EXPERTS` | **Not** `VLLM_*`. Default `0`. `1` applies `patches/hotfix-dsv4-tokentrace-experts.py` at boot: the V2 GPU model runner logs the top-k expert ids of every token for all 43 MoE layers, accepted output token IDs, and sampler counts per engine step to `DSPARK_TOKENTRACE_DIR` (default `/cache/huggingface/tokentrace`, i.e. host `~/.cache/huggingface/tokentrace`) on each node — see [TOKENTRACE.md](TOKENTRACE.md). IDs are stored instead of plaintext; an explicit same-host subscriber mode may detokenize them. `--enable-return-routed-experts` is **not** usable here: DSpark exists only in the V2 runner and V2 rejects that flag. Boot-time only. |
